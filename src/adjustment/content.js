Next, I selected specific variables for binning and determined the bin width based on various factors. Following this, I built two machine learning models: Naive Bayes and Neural Net. I evaluated their performance compared to the benchmark error rate and identified the one that performed the best. Subsequently, I employed ensemble methods such as boosting and bagging to assess whether they would result in a lower error rate. Finally, I documented my entire process and decisions in a comprehensive report.",

          Hi there! I'm Brandon, a 22 year-old from New York City, currently
          studying at Babson College. I'm currently looking for new job
          opportunities in product management.

          Designing and building has been in my DNA since I was 15 years old
          when I built my first video game. From launching my first startup to
          designing my first iOS and Android application, I have grown to love
          the intersection of business and technology.
